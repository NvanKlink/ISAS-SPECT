# ISAS-SPECT

This repository contains SPM Batch scripts for running ISAS analysis on interictal and ictal SPECT scans. 
The method was obtained from http://spect.yale.edu/indexSPM.html and adapted to work in SPM12. 
The control database (Healthy Normal database) is obtained from the same website: http://spect.yale.edu/downloads.html

How to use these scripts is described in INSTRUCTIONS

This code is not tested for clinical use, use at your own discretion.

Developped and tested in SPM12 v7487
